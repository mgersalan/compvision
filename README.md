We will use Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features for recognition of handwritten digits

TASKS

1 Load MNIST handwritten digit images from mnist.pkl.gz (sample code provided in file mnist.py)

2 Write a function that creates the LBP histogram features for a greyscale image given as an argument

3 Take, say, 1000 first training and testing MNIST images and calculate their LBP features

4 Use OpenCVâ€™s ml.KNearest_create() function to create a k-NN classifier

5 Train the classifier with the training data and test it with the testing data

6 Evaluate and report the classification accuracy
